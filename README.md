# COVID-era-shop
my first project

This is the final task given by [the Python course](https://www.facebook.com/mihainstitute/posts/pfbid02Jfi6oLW2dr4Wrup5QqaQ5inwqj5ZtYMLMzuEiqWaP4vLR7gD4qFuGK1rVKdKQurPl) I took.  
The goal was to create a simple program that can keep track of the customers while offering functionality to the seller & customers.  

Functions  
   - Seller:  
       - Add & remove items  
       - Keep track of customers  
   - Customers:  
       - Buy items
